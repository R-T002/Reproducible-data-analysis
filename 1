Exploring the NOAA Storm Database: US Severe Weather impacts on Health and Economics
Assignment
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. Use of the NOAA Storm Database is to be used to address the questions below and I need to show the code for your entire analysis. The analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries by using R to support the analysis.

Synopsis
The NOAA database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. This project looks at severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems.

Questions: This data analysis must address the following questions :
Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health ?

Question 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences ?

Results: Based on analysis of aggregate human and economic impacts seen with the data by storm event types :
Findings on Question 1: Tornado’s by far cause the most fatalities and injuries, by far the most signifcant harm to public health.

-> Excessive heat and flash flooding are second and third leading causes of fatalities.

-> Tornados cause by far more human injuries. Thunderstorm related events (Wind, Lightning, Flooding) combine to be a signficant injury contributor as well.

Findings on Question 2: Floods cause the most significant total damage (property and crop.)

-> While property damage is most significant with flooding, Hurricanes/Typhoons, and Tornados, and Storm Surge are also strong contributors to property damage as well

-> Crop damage occurs with flooding, but drought events are the most significant cause of economic harm crops. For crops flooding, ice storms, and hail are also noted contributors to economic harm.

Exploratory Data Analysis - by Question
QUESTION 1: Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health ?
To Answer this question, it’s assumed that harmful events with respect to population health comes from variables FATALITIES and INJURIES.

Question 1 - Data Preprocessing:
#Aggregate fatalities ad injuries by Event Type
fatalities <- aggregate(FATALITIES ~ EVTYPE, data=df, sum)
injuries <- aggregate(INJURIES ~ EVTYPE, data=df, sum)

#Arrange in descending order by Event Type by number of fatalities or injuries
fatalities <- arrange(fatalities,desc(FATALITIES),EVTYPE)[1:10,]
injuries <- arrange(injuries,desc(INJURIES),EVTYPE)[1:10,]

#convert event type variable to factor for analysis
fatalities$EVTYPE <- factor(fatalities$EVTYPE, levels = fatalities$EVTYPE)
injuries$EVTYPE <- factor(injuries$EVTYPE, levels = injuries$EVTYPE)

     top = textGrob("Public Health Impact - Fatalities & Injuries from top 10 Weather Events",gp=gpar(fontsize=14,font=3)))


QUESTION 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences ?
To Answer this question, it’s assumed that harmful events with respect to damage comes from variables Crop (CROPDMG) and Property (PROPDMG) damage.

Question 2 - Data Preprocessing:
Property and Crop Damage Values Degrees are Indicated by PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP which indicate decimal precision of the damage amounts. These damage estimates will need to be normalized to a common decimal precision.

#Normalize Event Damage Amount to Integer Format
tmpPROPDMG <- mapvalues(df$PROPDMGEXP,
                          c("K","M","", "B","m","+","0","5","6","?","4","2","3","h","7","H","-","1","8"), 
                          c(1e3,1e6, 1, 1e9,1e6,  1,  1,1e5,1e6,  1,1e4,1e2,1e3,  1,1e7,1e2,  1, 10,1e8))

tmpCROPDMG <- mapvalues(df$CROPDMGEXP,
                          c("","M","K","m","B","?","0","k","2"),
                          c( 1,1e6,1e3,1e6,1e9,1,1,1e3,1e2))

# Make Numeric Property and Crop Damage 
df$TOTAL_PROPDMG <- as.numeric(tmpPROPDMG) * df$PROPDMG #property damage
df$TOTAL_CROPDMG <- as.numeric(tmpCROPDMG) * df$CROPDMG #crop damage

# Create a Total Damage Amount which is the Total of Property and Crop Damage Amounts
df$TOTALDMG <- df$TOTAL_PROPDMG + df$TOTAL_CROPDMG

# Sum total damages for property and crop by Weather Event Type (EVTYPE):
propdamage <- aggregate(TOTAL_PROPDMG ~ EVTYPE, data=df, sum)
cropdamage <- aggregate(TOTAL_CROPDMG ~ EVTYPE, data=df, sum)

# Sum total damages (property + crop)  by Weather Event Type (EVTYPE):
totaldamage <- aggregate(TOTALDMG ~ EVTYPE, data=df, sum)

# Arrange descending damages for property and crop by Weather Event Type (EVTYPE) (Top 10 Events):
cropdamage <- arrange(cropdamage,desc(cropdamage$TOTAL_CROPDMG),EVTYPE)[1:10,]
propdamage <- arrange(propdamage,desc(propdamage$TOTAL_PROPDMG),EVTYPE)[1:10,]
